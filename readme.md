# Script Identifier

* A simple script to scrape elements and attributes from a given list of URLs. Helps you spot elements or attributes that might result in DOM XSS.

* Mainly designed for XSS Labs in Web Security Academy.


# Customizability

* You can tweak the program to your needs by adding any additional elements or attibutes for the program to scrape.

* Also to can add filters to filter out any unnecessary keywords.


# What is automated?

* Rather than enumerating the application and manually finding DOM XSS attack vectors (Ex: `<script>`, `onclick`). Can be tedious and time consuming.

* This program lets you automate this. Simply grab the URL you want to check and feed them into the program. Let the program takes cake of the rest.


# How the program works?

1. Enumerate the application. Copy the URLs for the `Burp HTTP History`.
2. Feed in the URLs to the program.


# Demo

* Will be upload in the future.
