## Script Identifier

* A simple script to scrape elements and attributes from a given list of URLs. Helps you spot elements or attributes that might result in DOM XSS.

* Mainly designed for XSS Labs in Web Security Academy.


## Customizability

* You can tweak the program to your needs by adding any additional elements or attibutes for the program to scrape.

* Also to can add filters to filter out any unnecessary keywords.


## What is automated?

* Rather than enumerating the application and manually finding DOM XSS attack vectors (Ex: `<script>`, `onclick`) by going through the source code. Can be tedious and time consuming.

* This program lets you automate this. Simply grab the URLs you want to check and feed them into the program. Let the program takes cake of the rest.


## How the program works?

1. Enumerate the application. Copy the URLs from `Burp HTTP History` tab.
2. Feed in the URLs to the program.
